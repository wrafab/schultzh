<h1> Week 6</h1>
<h2> Skateboards and Molds </h2>

<hr style="width:50%">

<h3> Skateboard </h3>
<p> 
Megan and I made a skateboard.I helped her because I missed the first class that week when they started them. The first step was gluing the boards together then we put it in between two boards and clipped them together to press the skateboard together. I missed the next 2 classes and Megan spray painted the skateboard and designed it. 
  For my mold, I made an H on auto desk fusion. Then I made it into an STL file and sent it to Mr. Gerber. Mr. Gerber printed the file out. Then we mixed and poured edible molding into the templates.We let the molds sit for 24 hours and then took them out from the templates. We then melted chocloate and poured the chocolate in.
