<h3> Project | Golf Ball and Newspaper Tower Challenge</h3>
<p> 
We had two challeges the first day of class. The first one we did was the golf ball challenge where we were given straws and a golf ball. We had to use the straws to create a contraption that would hold the golfball. We tried using a triangle method, but ours failed. 
  The newspaper tower challenge was also pretty hard. We rolled the newspaper diagonally to give our tower length. However, our base was not solid enough to sustain our tower so it fell over at the end. The second and third days, I worked on learning basic coding and created this webpage. I helped strategize and come up with the original plan and shape for the golf ball challenge. I also helped rolled the newspaper and helped build a base for the tower.
