<h2> Embroidery and Sewing </h2>

<hr style="width:50%">

<h3> Earmuffs </h3>
<p> 
Today we did embroidery. I made earmuffs and put my initials on it. It was super easy to do the design right on the machine and didn't take more than 5 minutes to do. We also made pillow cases with the sewing machine. We started by choosing cutting fabric and then pinning an foldin it. I liked sewing because it was easier for me to do.
