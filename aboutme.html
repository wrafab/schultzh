<hr style="width:75%">

<p> My name is Hayley Schultz. I'm a senior at Western Reserve Academy. I like to play tennis and sail. Follow me on instagram @hayleyyschultz </p>
I wanted to take the class because I had no clue how to use any of the machines. I had another class slot to fill and I thought I would learn useful skills in this class. I wanted to be more familiar with the machines and be knowledgable on how to use them.
