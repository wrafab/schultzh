<p> 
The final project took mea while to think of. I made a tshirt. I used 5 different processes. I went online and downloaded a picture of santa to start off. Then I printed the tshirt with the santa design. After this, I embroidered merry x mas with the embriodery machine. I then decided I wanted a christmas tree sewn on. So I went online and hairlined a design of a christmas tree. I put fabric in the laser cutter and laser cut a christmas tree. After this, I used a sewing machine to sew the tree on. Then after this, I saudered my lights to the battery adn created a pocket for the battery to sit in the shirt.
